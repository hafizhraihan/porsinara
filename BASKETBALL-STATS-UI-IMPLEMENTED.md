2. **API Call**: `saveBasketballStats(matchId, [{player_id, ...stats}])`
3. **Database**: 
   - Deletes old stats for that match/player (if exists)
   - Inserts new stats record
   - **Trigger fires** → calculates `total_points` and `total_rebound`
4. **Success Toast**: "Basketball stats saved successfully!"
5. **Form Reset**: Ready for next player
